# VuePress 2 not Working in Docker

## Running locally works
1. `cd vuepress-app`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run docs:dev`
4. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in a web browser

## Running in Docker does not work
1. `docker-compose up --build`

Looking at the last two lines in the output below, VuePress should be up and running, but opening [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in the web browsers times out after a while, and line 2 below (`9/10`) suggest the build is not finished, and the timer (`70.0s`) continues to tick.
